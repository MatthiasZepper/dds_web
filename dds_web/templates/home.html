    <h1>Welcome to the Data Delivery System Web Interface!</h1>

    <p>
        The Data Delivery System (DDS) is a system designed for the simple and secure delivery of data from SciLifeLab
        facilities to their users.
        The DDS uses Safespring's object-storage as the delivery medium and has built-in encryption and key management
        in order to simplify the data delivery as much as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the Web Interface, both account types (facilities and users) can track projects and see all the uploaded data
        within the projects connected to their accounts.
        However, only facilities can upload, and only users can download the data. The Web Interface is for small and
        few files only.
        If something connected to upload and download does not work, try using a smaller file or folder.
